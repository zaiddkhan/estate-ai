As an international and globally recognized hotel brand, I expected the breakfast to reflect that standard. Unfortunately, it falls short in several areas: ‚Ä¢	The breakfast lacks international variety and is repeated every day without any change, which becomes boring and does not meet five-star expectations. ‚Ä¢	The food quality is not up to international standards, and there‚Äôs no care taken by the restaurant management to improve or adjust the menu. ‚Ä¢	The restaurant staff are friendly and professional, but the management needs to pay closer attention to guest satisfaction, especially for such an important meal.  This feedback is meant as a constructive suggestion, because I believe a hotel of this reputation should offer a more dynamic, high-quality, and internationally appealing breakfast.",en,,2025-07-29T16:36:17.592529314Z,,2025-09-03T10:59:18.890Z

My family was sitting in the allotted room for almost 2 hours uncomfortably. After much follow up, I was given one room with king bed and had again to wait for another room for a while. Finally I got second room around 3.45 pm.I had plans to take rest and go for a swim in the pool, but because of the delayed check in, all my plans went for a toss. One of the rooms allotted had an uncleaned window therby obstructing the sea view for which I had specifically booked.  Next day morning, for breakfast at 9.30 am, there were 15 people waiting in the line outside the restaurant. We were asked to go to the other restaurant below. I had asked for a table for 5 which was given with 5 chairs and  only 4 table mats. Had to again wait for sometime requesting them to put the mat and the cutlery. Most of the food items were not even warm. Taste was just so so. Had to wait for bowls for sambar.

The spread, freshness, and flavors were top-tier. A must-experience. ‚Ä¢	Cleanliness & Amenities: Rooms were spotless, beds comfortable, and all amenities including spa, sauna, and swimming pool were well-managed and relaxing. ‚Ä¢	Location: You really can‚Äôt beat it ‚Äî central, premium, and peaceful. ‚Ä¢	Special Mention: Paaji (Doorman/Host): A true gem! Right from the entrance, he made us feel at home. He greeted us with a respectful Namaste, handled our luggage smoothly, and opened the doors with genuine warmth. That‚Äôs the kind of welcome you expect from a luxury brand.  ‚ùå Where things fell flat: ‚Ä¢	Customer Relations: I emailed my room preferences (pool view, specific requests) well before arrival ‚Äî but received no response, and none of the requests were honored. ‚Ä¢	Check-In Experience: Disappointing. The receptionist was cold and unwelcoming, no smile, no welcome drink, no personal touch.

The service has been consistently poor ‚Äî dialing ‚Äò0‚Äô for assistance goes unanswered, the front desk is uninterested and slow, and overall responsiveness is lacking.  One of the restaurants was entirely empty, with no staff in sight. I had to physically walk over to an adjacent space to find someone to serve. The soda was served warm, and when questioned, staff candidly admitted that cost-cutting measures were the reason behind such lapses. And did nothing about it! It was evident they were not expecting guests, which is alarming for any hospitality business, let alone one advertising itself as a premium hotel.  The furniture feels dated, and while the bathrooms are acceptable, nothing about the property justifies a 5-star rating. If this hotel had claimed to be a 3-star, I wouldn‚Äôt have felt compelled to leave a review ‚Äî my expectations would have been set accordingly. But this level of service and preparedness is simply misleading and unacceptable under a 5-star banner. In the age of digital bookings, we rely on pictures and rating to make our decisions.  That said, I do feel for the staff trying to make do in an environment clearly hampered by underinvestment and poor management decisions.

First, my bathroom was full of mosquitoes since there was an opening hole for them. I always had to make sure that I didn't leave the light on there. The door to the bathroom also wasn't able to close fully, so they would also come into my sleeping room. But the worst thing in there was that at some daytime you could hear a bigger animal above the ceiling of the bathroom. I was always afraid a rat or something could crash in. However, I stayed because of budget reasons.  The next blow didn't wait for long. I felt a little bit sick after the first night with the aircon on. Didn't think much about it. But after the second night I was totally sick and needed to recover in that hotel room with no aircon since it obviously hadn't been cleaned and made people sick. I never had a problem with getting sick from an ac and have travelled over 9 months in tropical countries. The health issues clearly must have been from an uncleaned ac.
